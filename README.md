## Abstract
<p align="justify"> 
Freshwater temporary pools are ephemeral aquatic habitats characterized by fluctuating water levels and high environmental variability in structural and physicochemical parameters. These ecosystems support diverse fish communities and play crucial ecological roles in maintaining local biodiversity. However, they face increasing threats from anthropogenic activities such as urbanization, pollution and habitat degradation. This systematic review, covering from 1981 to 2023, analyses 108 peer-reviewed articles to uncover global research trends and gaps concerning fish inhabiting freshwater temporary pools. The analysis reveals an increase in publications after 2010, which reflects a growing scientific interest on the topic. Geographically, research was concentrated in South America and Africa, particularly in Brazil. Reproduction and taxonomy were the most common study areas, with the focus primarily on Rivulidae and Nothobranchiidae. Notably, 61 species of Rivulidae and 10 of Nothobranchiidae were studied, while other 100 species, mainly addressed through community-level studies, received limited attention. Despite this, significant knowledge gaps persist in areas such as ecotoxicology, physiology, trophic ecology, and behavior. Our findings emphasize the need for more comprehensive research to support effective conservation strategies. A broader focus on other fish clades and ecological aspects will be critical for protecting the biodiversity and ecological integrity of these vulnerable ecosystems.
